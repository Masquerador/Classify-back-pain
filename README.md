# Classify-back-pain
Lower back pain can be caused due to a variety of reasons and it is one of the most common medical condition in the modern world. Proper identification of the cause of the back pain can widely help in the treatment of lower back pain. Lower back pain can be caused due to various problems related with spine, nerves, ligaments, joints or tendons. Based on this, lower back pain can be categorized into two main categories, one caused by the damage to non-neural tissue with a functioning nervous system and the other caused by dysfunction in the nervous system. Usually clinical experts perform the task of identifying the cause of lower back pain from the results of various tests conducted on the patient, the symptoms recorded by the patient and their different attributes.
In this project we will use different machine learning classification techniques to classify the types of lower back pain based on the results of the tests, the symptoms recorded by the patient and their different attributes. Since this task is related to medical science and needs very accurate results, we will find the classification model that classifies the lower back pain with the best accuracy in a consistent manner. We will also identify the important variables/parameters that will aid in proper classification.
